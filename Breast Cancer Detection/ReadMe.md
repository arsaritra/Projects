# Overview


- Two machine learning (ML) algorithms namely K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Support Vector - Machine (SVM) compared by measuring their classification test accuracy.
- Python was used programming language was used for implementing ML algorithms.
- Out of the total Dataset, 70% was partitioned for training phase and 30% for the testing phase.
- K fold-cross validation performed for determining accuracy.
- Both algorithms gave 95% accuracy.
